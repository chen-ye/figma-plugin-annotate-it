If you want to install the current beta version of the plugin, simply just

Extract the downloaded zip.

Than open Figma and 
1. Click on your name
2. Go to "Plugins"
3. Select the "+"-Button next to "Create your own plugin"
4. Hit "Click to choose a manifest.json file" and choose `/annotate-it-vx.x.x/manifest.json` (the x stands for the version number, so for example `annotate-it-v1.0.0`)
